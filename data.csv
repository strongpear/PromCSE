Free body diagrams assist us in breaking the system down, and it makes it easier for us to recognize these forces and break it up into components. Since looking at the system, technically there are no ""external"" forces acting, so drawing a free body diagram at point A, and labeling our boundaries around it, will help us create external forces around that point, which will help us solve our problem.
